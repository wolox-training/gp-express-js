# gp-express-js



## First steps

#### Installing node
Get the latest version of node from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/) or using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
Nvm approach is preferred.

#### Getting dependencies
Run ```npm install``` or ```yarn``` from rootpath of the project.

#### Kickoff - Removing sample project
First run ```npm install prompt``` and then run ```node ./scripts/kick-off.js``` from project's rootpath to remove the existing sample project and start developing your app.

#### Database configuration
Before running the app, make sure you have [postgresql installed](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-14-04) and a db created, to create it run the following steps inside a psql terminal:
1. CREATE DATABASE db_project_name;
2. \c db_project_name
3. CREATE ROLE "project_name" LOGIN CREATEDB PASSWORD 'project_name';

Then, set in `.env` some variables:
- `DB_HOST=localhost`
- `DB_PORT=5432`
- `DB_NAME=db_project_name`
- `DB_USERNAME=project_name`
- `DB_PASSWORD=project_name`

### Migrations

To create a migration, run `./node_modules/.bin/sequelize migration:create --name="my-migration-name" --config ./migrations/config.js --migrations-path ./migrations/migrations`.

To run them, execute `npm run migrations`.

#### Starting your app
Now, to start your app run ```npm start``` in the rootpath of the project. Then access your app at **localhost:port**. The port is logged in the console where you ran the start script.

## Development

#### Environments
By default, the environment will be **development**, but you can easily change it using the **NODE_ENV** environmental variable.

#### Environment variables
`Dotenv` is used for managing environment variables. They are stored in the `/.env` file. Take into account that the variables defined in the `bashrc` are not overrided.

The environment variables should be added to the `.env` file in the form of `NAME=VALUE`, as the following example:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=superpass
```

**Remember not to push nor commit the `.env` file.**

#### Logging
To log useful information of your program to the console you just need to import the logger located at `app/logger`. There are two possible types of logging: `info` and `error`. You should use them depending on the type of message you want to show.

Here is an example snippet:
```
const logger = require('/app/logger');
...
if (error) { 
    logger.error('There is an error);
} else {
    logger.infCREATE ROLE "project_name" LOGIN CREATEDB PASSWORD 'project_name';
}
```

#### DebuggingCREATE ROLE "project_name" LOGIN CREATEDB PASSWORD 'project_name';
As we know, a NodeJS application is not something easy to debug and because of that we've added the `--inspect` flag to make it simpler. Chrome DevTools will get started when running your app using the start script (`npm start`), making your debugging easier.

#### REPL console
We can use a node console with `npm run console`. There your service objects are exposed as _servicename_ + "Service". Let's suppose that we have a service `users` which has a function `getAll`. In your console you can call `usersService.getAll()` and see the result. Note that this works also with functions that return promises! To exit the console use `.exit`.

#### Documentation
Documentation will be served at `/docs`. Remember using [dictum.js](http://www.github.com/Wolox/dictum.js) package to automatically generate documentation for your endpoints. Check [this link](https://github.com/Wolox/dictum.js#chai) for further details.

## Deploy

#### Heroku
Pushing the desired branch to heroku should be enough.
